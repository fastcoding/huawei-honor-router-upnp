## About

Written just for myself and home use, A lua script uses uPnP to set port mapping on HUAWEI honor router (home version)

The source codes are based on the upnpclient (in luarocks), but its XML parser does not work on uPnP XML from HuaWei router. I replaced it with xml2lua

## INSTALL

    luarock install xml2lua
